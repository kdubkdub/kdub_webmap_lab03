Project Name: US COVID-19 Mapping Project

Brief Introduction:
The US COVID-19 Mapping Project aims to visualize the spread of COVID-19 cases and rates across counties in the United States during the year 2020. The project utilizes GIS techniques to create thematic maps, including a choropleth map showing COVID-19 rates and a proportional symbols map displaying COVID-19 cases. These maps provide insights into the geographical distribution of COVID-19 impact and help in understanding the disparities in infection rates across different regions.

Primary Functions:

    Choropleth Map: Utilizes GeoJSON data and Mapbox GL JS library to visualize COVID-19 rates per thousand residents at the county level. The map color-codes counties based on their respective rates, providing a visual representation of the severity of COVID-19 impact.
    Proportional Symbols Map: Utilizes GeoJSON data and Mapbox GL JS library to visualize COVID-19 cases at the county level using proportional symbols. The size of the symbols represents the number of COVID-19 cases in each county, allowing for easy comparison of case counts across regions.

Libraries in Use:

    Mapbox GL JS: A JavaScript library for interactive, customizable maps.
    GitHub Pages: Hosting platform for static websites, allowing for easy sharing of map visualizations.

Data Sources:

    COVID-19 Case/Death Data: Originally from The New York Times, covering all cases in 2020.
    Population Data: 2018 ACS 5-year estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau, used for calculating case rates.
    U.S. County Boundary Shapefile: Downloaded from the U.S. Census Bureau.

Credit & Acknowledgment:
The COVID-19 case/death data and population data used in this project were processed to suit the purpose of this lab. Credit goes to The New York Times for providing the COVID-19 data and the U.S. Census Bureau for the county boundary shapefile. Special thanks to [Instructor Name] for guidance and support throughout the project.
